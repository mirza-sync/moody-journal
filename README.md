## Dev Logs

1. Haven't write the logs for a long while. Was busy with work. Losing motivation to code lately. I tried to commit once a day (or not), but honestly most of it were just stupid commits (updating readme, delete unused file, etc). I'm not feeling productive at all...

2. Anyways, I've done the prisma setup. Haven't heard the term "migration" after a long while. Last time I used it was when writing migration in Laravel.

3. Btw, look at this [db helper util](https://github.com/mirza-sync/moody-journal/blob/main/utils/db.ts), and compare it to [this one](https://fullstack-v2-instructions.vercel.app/lessons/db/helper) from v2 tutorial. The former is more compact, but I think the latter one was easier to understand. It reminds me of the singleton pattern. The graphql connecter helper also instantiated in a similar way iirc.
