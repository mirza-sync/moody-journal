## Dev Logs

1. Haven't write the logs for a long while. Was busy with work. Losing motivation to code lately. I tried to commit once a day (or not), but honestly most of it were just stupid commits (updating readme, delete unused file, etc). I'm not feeling productive at all...

2. Anyways, I've done the prisma setup. Haven't heard the term "migration" after a long while. Last time I used it was when writing migration in Laravel.

3. Btw, look at this [db helper util](https://github.com/mirza-sync/moody-journal/blob/main/utils/db.ts), and compare it to [this one](https://fullstack-v2-instructions.vercel.app/lessons/db/helper) from v2 tutorial. The former is more compact, but I think the latter one was easier to understand. It reminds me of the singleton pattern. The graphql connecter helper also instantiated in a similar way iirc.

4. Creating the api feels weird... Writing the endpoint, then write the backend code. But then I realized I'm doing frontend & backend together, then things starts to make sense. There's no need to jump between repos and less context switching since everything is Typescript. Next.js rocks.

5. Prisma doesn't work on client component. So how do I get the data type of what's returned from prisma and pass the type to the props so that I'll have type checking in my client component? It turns out that based on the `@prisma/client` the was generated, I can just import the types that exist in the schema. Cool.

6. Encountered some overflow issues today. First, the width of dashboard layout is `100vw`. So when overflow-y happen, a the browser will show a vertical scroll bar as usual. However, the vertical scroll bar width is not subtracted from the 100vw. Hence a horizontal scroll bar appeared! So annoying. [Smashing Magazine has a good article discussing this issue](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/12/new-css-viewport-units-not-solve-classic-scrollbar-problem/). Second, when the content of the page exceed the browser height, a vertical scroll bar will appear so that user able to scroll down. However, since I set the height of the layout to be `100vh`, the content overflowed outside of the layout div. I tried to set html's and body's height to 100%. It works at first, but when I snap the Chrome Dev Tools on the left side, the issue happens again. Weird... Solution: set `overflow: hidden` on html. Then add `overflow-y: auto` on layout's main element. Refer commit [776ae52](776ae52951916c3fb30b4ce0e10e4b27bf37ad11)

7. Wrote a compound unique index using `@@unique` just now. Is this similar to composite key, where we combine two primary key to make a new unique key?

8. Ever since the launch of my company's new software 2 weeks ago, I haven't touch my personal project for weeks! I'm tired. Losing discipline. Need to rebuild the consistencies.

9. Btw, I updated something in the schema. Then uses the `npx prisma db push` command instead of `prisma migrate dev`. In the prisma docs, they make those commands sounds similar. But ran the former command and realize that the migration wasn't created for my onDelete cascade rule. I ran the latter command to create the migration. Then prisma warns me that the prisma client and the db was not in sync. I was forced to delete all my data ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Just putting a note here hoping that I wont make the same mistake again.

10. Ok, I updated a journal entry and ran update analysis endpoint after. It gets updated on the backend. But the frontend state wasn't in sync. Need to move the part that renders the analysis data into the `Editor` component which was a client component... To be honest, SSR started to feel kinda complicated right now. I need to know which data goes to server component or client component. Kinda annoying. But maybe I'll get a hang of it if I uses NextJs a lot more.

11. Back to coding this project after being abandoned for the whole week. Greeted with the message that my Railway trial has expired. Lose access to my hosted database. Gotta setup a local db now.
